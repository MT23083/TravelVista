From the hotel to our room being really clean to the whole staff being amazing everyone was so nice and friendly. Nessa, Blanca & Mitch. From the rest of the Valet parking being so nice but didn't get the rest of their names. Truly nice hotel with excellent staff. When I come to San Francisco I will forsure stay at The Marker no hesitation. Great hospitality by housekeeping team and front desk. This was my best memorable stay of my life. We had the most amazing time staying and having wine IN THE FIREPLACE!!! Such a cute room and the staff was incredible from Bianca who checked us to Melinda who took our photos in the lobby! The valet was very professional and the restaurant made for the perfect breakfast. We will be back!!\",\n",

You can't really use the balcony because the city has filthy air, so it's not pleasant sitting outside in the pollution. But also the noise of traffic, honking horns, etc. is nonstop. Unless you're a very deep sleeper and can sleep in noisy environments, don't stay in one of these rooms. I was in 912.\\n\\nThey moved me to another room (1426?) which didn't have a balcony. The room was not as nice but it was not as loud, so I could get some sleep. Not ideal though. The other side of the hotel faces a shopping mall with bars, so on weekends will be very loud until after 1am.\\n\\nThe curtains they have are inadequate considering the noise. They should have, especially in balcony rooms, very heavy blackout soundproofing curtains.\\n\\nBreakfast is good and much better, cleaner, and better managed than ITC Gardenia. The executive lounge for platinum members is also much better than ITC Gardenia. Gym is good. Pool looks nice, but didn't use it. Again, it's not nice being outside with such bad air quality.\\n\\nTV is not an updated or smart TV.\\n\\nFront desk staff are nice and dealt with issues as best as they could.\",\n",

The decision to accommodate over 400 kids without proper vetting procedures was not only imprudent but also irresponsible. Locking them in Sutra without air conditioning and access to basic amenities like water, which are essential rights, was deeply troubling and in violation of government regulations. Moreover, labeling the event as a high tea and failing to provide adequate food for minor attendees is unacceptable. These issues represent just the tip of the iceberg. The absence of security measures and insufficient lighting in the outdoor area further compounded the risks, especially considering it was a coed gathering. We commend the parents for their swift intervention in averting any potential incidents. Despite repeated pleas, it's disheartening that the hotel failed to address our concerns adequately.\",\n",
