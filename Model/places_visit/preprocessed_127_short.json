A team of experts surveyed more than 40 caves several days amidst all dangers in the dense forest. These are Buddhist caves. Most of these are related to Buddhism. Locals believe there can be more than 100 caves in Bandhavgarh Park area. There's a lot of Kushan-e-era Brahmi records. Survey of five big temples has been done so far. The heights are parakottedar forts. Caves, temples, records and large statues scattered among the forest in the plain area. The statues are up to 20 feet tall.\nOverall this is a very good archeological and historical site. It should be preserved well.",
