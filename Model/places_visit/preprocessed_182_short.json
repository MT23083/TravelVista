On our last day for our day tour at Dharamshala, we chose to travel to Dharamshala via Skyway. Located in the middle of Mall Road, after simple security check in, they provide 2 options - One way ticket for Rs 450 while two way ticket costs 675 Rs. We reached around 11 am and had to wait for approx 10 mins. In a single cabin, around 6 to 8 ppl can sit. Since there were not many ppl around, we got a chance to have the cabin to ourselves (2 ppl). The views are amazing. Ride takes around 10 mins and we get to see the mountain, valley and city views. Nice experience overall. Once we reached Dharamshala, you need to walk slope to reach at top where all cars are parked in.",
