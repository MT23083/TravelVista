Nestled within the walls of a 450-year-old Portuguese fort, this property offers guests an immersive experience that transports them back in time while still providing all the comforts of a high-end resort.\n\nUpon arrival, the sheer scale and grandeur of the fort are immediately awe-inspiring. The beautifully preserved structure, with its impressive ramparts and striking white facade, instantly sets the tone for an unforgettable stay. As you step through the entryway, the transition from the bustling outside world to the serene, almost meditative atmosphere of the hotel grounds is palpable.\n\nThe suites are uniquely designed, paying homage to the property's storied past while offering every contemporary amenity. Each of them is designed with Portuguese interiors and cutely named after the seven days of the week.  Spacious layouts, plush furnishings, and stunning views of the Tiracol River or the Arabian Sea create an undeniably regal ambiance. The attention to historical detail is remarkable, with elements like exposed stone walls and antique furniture pieces effortlessly complementing the modern comforts.\n\nWhat truly sets Fort Tiracol apart, however, is its ability to transport guests to a bygone era while still providing all the luxuries of a modern resort. The seamless blend of historical ambiance and contemporary comforts creates an experience that is truly unparalleled, making it a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a unique and unforgettable stay in Goa.\n\nLOCATION: Close to the Konkan coast of Maharashtra than Goa, it is located within easy reach from popular beaches of Goa like ARAMBOL, MAJORIM, QUERNEM, etc.\n\nDINE + DRINK: The in-house lounge bar (called The TAVERN) is an ode to old Portuguese taverns and comes with lovely views of the Sea. There\u2019s also an all-day caf\u00e9 serving Goan, Indian, and European snacks and pastries right by the river\n\nROOM: We stayed in a Room called FRIDAY, so this review is based on that;  SIZE: Spacious enough for 2 adults and simple baggage; VIEW: Sweet view of the sea from the cute attached balcony; AIR-CON: Perfectly functioning cooler that helped in setting the perfect room temperature; BED: Comfortable bed that played the expected part of putting us to sleep; BATHROOM: Stand-in shower; TOILETRIES: Good quality toiletries by INARA brand\n\nFACILITIES: No Gym or pool on site, pure Beachfront chill!\n\nSERVICE: Friendly staff that took care of all our needs with a smile and made us feel pampered and well taken care of.\n\nHOW WIRED YOU WILL BE: Free Wi-Fi that works well all over the property, and the speed is good! Big Smart TV dishing out a wide variety of channels spanning sports, news, music, movies, and  entertainment in multiple languages",

The vantage point provides a perfect spot to admire the beauty of nature and soak in the tranquil atmosphere.\n\nThe bridge itself is a marvel of engineering, elegantly spanning across the river with its impressive structure. The sight of the river flowing gently beneath it is mesmerizing, especially during sunrise or sunset when the sky is painted in vibrant hues, creating a magical ambiance.\n\nThe view from the Aronda Bridge is truly captivating. As I stood there, I could see the boats gliding along the river, adding a touch of serenity to the panorama. The surrounding landscape, with its dense forests and rolling hills, further enhances the beauty of the place, making it a paradise for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Aronda Bridge View Point is the sense of tranquility it offers. Away from the bustling city life, the peaceful ambiance allows visitors to disconnect from their daily routines and immerse themselves in the natural surroundings. It's an ideal spot to relax, unwind, and appreciate the simple joys of life.\n\nThe accessibility to the viewpoint is convenient, with ample parking facilities available nearby. Additionally, there are a few small vendors offering refreshments and snacks, making it convenient to grab a quick bite while enjoying the scenic view.\n\nWhile the Aronda Bridge View Point is undoubtedly a picturesque location, it could benefit from some additional amenities to enhance the visitor experience. Adding seating arrangements or picnic spots would provide visitors with more comfort while they spend time admiring the view.\n\nOverall, the Aronda Bridge View Point is a hidden gem in Goa, offering a serene escape amidst nature's splendor. It is an ideal place to witness the beauty of the region and capture some incredible photographs. If you're seeking tranquility and a chance to immerse yourself in nature's embrace, I highly recommend paying a visit to the Aronda Bridge View Point during your Goa trip.",
