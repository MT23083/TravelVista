Located in South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India, it provides a peaceful retreat for beach enthusiasts. The beach offers a relaxed atmosphere, and visitors can enjoy long walks along the coastline.

There are transport options available to reach Bakkhali from the rail stations. This beach is not yet over-crowded.  There are many shops around and one can best enjoy the spectacular sun-set view and definitely can linger on a rent chair to spend the evening time along with a cup of coffee. We have visited this place multiple times during the summer.",

I remember going pretty far into the water and still not be too deep. The waves also appeared calm even during the peak high tide. The best part was however the presence of life guards in the water who were keeping a watch and preventing people from venturing deep. The only thing I hated about the place was the public washroom. The ladies' washroom was pathetic and practically crowded with locals. Three or four ladies were randomly taking bath together leaving the washroom more messy. If you have ladies in your group who plan to take a shower post their beach activities, do book a hotel room instead of relying on local washrooms.\n\nThis is a sort of family beach......you wont find any shacks selling drinks on the beach. It might be a bummer for some of you guys. Also better to avoid two piece swimsuits here as this beach being overcrowded can invite unwanted stares, a cute playsuit or shorts would look equally well though! Indeed, for a short weekend trip, it is an ideal spot.",

The problem is that the sea that people come here to see is far away.  You can bathe in the sea only when the tide comes.  Another big reason for its loss of popularity is that people have to face a lot of problems here when bringing a car.  I am drawing the attention of the administration in this matter.",

An acquaintance brother of mine has his home in Bakkhali and he brought me to this beach. I fell in love with this beach at first sight, this beach is lonely and beautiful. When the tide comes in, the water overwhelms the long beach and at low tide it becomes even more beautiful with red crabs, as if someone has decorated the beach with rose petals. The beach was damaged by typhoon Ayala so the government planted a lot of jhow trees, today those jhow trees may have grown too big. This is one of my favorite unknown places.I love \u2764\ufe0f this place. Propulsion is low but SEA BEACH AREA is beautiful to enjoy with friends.",
