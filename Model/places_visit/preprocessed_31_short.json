They don't even deserve a single star.\n\nRegarding the cruising time: Despite their claims, the actual cruising time is maximum 2 hours, including the return to the starting point.\n\nRooms: The rooms are incredibly small, and the air conditioners do not function properly. Even after running continuously for 5 to 6 hours, the rooms remain uncomfortably warm. Upon contacting them, I was informed that remotes were not available, and the temperature was already set up.\n\nDining hall: The air conditioning in the dining hall operates for a maximum of 2 hours during lunch and dinner.\n\nFood: Unless you are accustomed to Kerala cuisine, you will likely not enjoy the food. Despite being comfortable with both South and North Indian cuisine, I found the food unsatisfactory. Only the fish fry was decent.\n\nOverall: The boat is often parked in locations where the view is obstructed by other boats, limiting the enjoyment of the surroundings. During the daytime, the high temperatures inside the tiny rooms make them unbearable, while the upper deck is also uncomfortable due to the lack of air conditioning.",
