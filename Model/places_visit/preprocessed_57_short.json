We had to go on different steep roads and only high power cars can climb or you can park your car down and walk for 15 mins. The jeep drivers helped us to navigate through the unmaped roads in gmaps. The map showed a difficult road since it's wrongly located on maps but there is a very decent road to the falls.and only jeeps can climb.\n\nVery clean water, 3 places you can bath , water is very clean you can climb some rocks to go to the falls not dangerous at all\n\nThe waterfall's majestic cascade captivates with its sheet power , creating a mesmerizing display of nature's beauty. The roaring sound, combined with the misty spray, enhances the sensory experience, making it a breathtaking and rejuvenating sight .the surro lush greenery adds to the overall enchantment,making it a must -visit destination for nature enthusiasts.",

A slightly remote area in forest fringes and along the proposed 'Munnar rajapatha'. Small shops run by local people, ice-cream vendors etc seen around. Plenty of space for parking by roadside. No toilet facilities. Anakkulam is a nearby attraction.\n\nThe public can get down at two points: near the river and on the rocky platform to get a better view of the waterfall. There are no tourist guides or rescue team. Be careful not to slip n fall over the rocks. Even if the rocks are dry, you might slip once you step on them with wet legs.\n\nThere is an old bridge over the river which leads to Perumbankuthu forest Outpost, beyond which movement is restricted. The bamboos lining the entrance to bridge form a lush green arch. The river flows over rocky slopes and turns into a wide n beautiful waterfall which is better viewed from below. There is a narrow walkable steep mud path along the roadside leading to the waterfall. The path ends upon a rocky platform from where one can have a beautiful view of the waterfall that continues further downwards into a bigger waterfall.\n\nReach via machiplavu - korangatty - Mankulam -Perumbankuthu Rd while travelling towards Munnar. Place is included in various KSRTC tour packages.\nNB: Photos posted are from visit during the dry season.",

Water plunges from a considerable height from the southern side and flows to the eastern direction. A check dam has been built where the water touches the ground. One can enjoy the sight of the falls from the check dam as well as the nearby rocks.\nThe British reached Munnar from Kochi via Aluva. They built a bridge across the Nallathanniyar at Perumbankuthu, near Mankulam, along the road stretching parallel to the banks of the Periyar river.  This bridge, with iron rails, is still intact after all these years. The biggest waterfall in Mankulam, Perumbankuthu, is downstream of this bridge. It has as much water as the famed Athirappilli falls, but cannot be approached as no protective fences have been built. However, eager visitor can view the waterfalls, which is a good 100 m high, from a nearby rubber plantation.",

It's a suspension bridge that offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.\n\nThe original bridge was unfortunately damaged in the 2019 floods, but a new bridge was opened in April 2021.\nThe new bridge is sturdier and more weather-resistant than the old one, making it a safe and enjoyable experience for visitors.\n\nThe bridge provides breathtaking views of the surrounding valley and river. It's a photographer's delight, especially for scenic shots below the bridge.\nLocated right off the road, the bridge makes for a quick and easy break on your journey to Munnar. Shops opposite the bridge offer refreshments and souvenirs, and restrooms are available nearby.\n\nThe bridge appears old and could benefit from better maintenance. While sturdy enough to walk on, the side-to-side movement when crowded may be unsettling for some, especially those with a fear of heights.\n\nThe bridge tends to get crowded, especially during peak season, making the swaying more pronounced. If you're concerned about safety, proceed with caution and avoid peak times.\n\nSome additional details about the Hanging Bridge:\n\nIt is located about 6 miles from Munnar town. I think it is open from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM.\n\nThere is no entry fee. Parking is available nearby.\n\nVisit during off-peak hours to avoid large crowds and minimize movement.\n\nHold onto the railings for added stability while crossing.\n\nIf you have concerns about heights or safety, it's best to skip the bridge and enjoy the view from the banks of the river.",
