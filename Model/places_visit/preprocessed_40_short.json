Locals warn you of leopard sightings even during the day at the waterfall, so it is advisable to go in a group. Both the path and the place are deserted. When you reach, the view is simply amazing! In the Monsoons, its gorgeous! Be careful with selfies though, people have slipped, and the water is freezing. Once done, do take all your garbage as you leave.
