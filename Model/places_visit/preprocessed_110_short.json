Their swords were also buried with the warriors. And also some utensils etc. were also buried. This is the first civilization where evidence of burning and burial has been found together.\nBodies of women warriors have also been found in Sinauli. But the legs of all the women warriors were chopped off.\nNow a new discovery has been made in Sinauli in which a chariot has been found there. Carbon dating has shown that this chariot belongs to the time when the world did not even know the bullock cart properly. This chariot was driven by horses. Many more evidences have been found in Sinauli. For example, for the first time, the use of four pillars has been found to keep the graves above the ground.\nBefore the evidence found in Sinauli, it was believed that India had never made weapons and weapons were brought to India from other countries. But the evidence found in Sinauli shows that India had started making weapons even before the world.\nSinauli has once again proved that India has taught everything to the world. India was and will remain a world leader.\n\nThanks for reading my review.",
