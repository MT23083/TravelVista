Of these, a bunch of cells were designated for solitary confinement, and have accordingly forbidding interiors. Included in the cells  are two very special ones: one, equipped with a fireplace and decorated now with a charkha (spinning wheel), housed Gandhiji (at his special request) when he visited Dagshai in 1920. Another cell, almost next to the main entrance to the prison, housed, for a while, his future assassin, Nathuram Godse.\n\nAlso worth seeing in the jail is an interesting and creepy torture chamber, with rusted chains hanging from a bar on one wall, while battered wooden doors lead out into the courtyard beyond: victims of brutal punishment would be led out that way, whether half-alive or as corpses.\n\nThere is also a room that\u2019s devoted to memories of Dagshai and the military regiments that were stationed around here. Pride of place is given to a famous military tune, \u2018Dagshai Hills\u2019, with the musical notes for it, as well as photos and paintings of military musicians playing the tune.",
