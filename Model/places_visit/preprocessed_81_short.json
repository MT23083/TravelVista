Visited during what felt like the church's exclusive \"No People Allowed\" hours. If you're spiritually inclined, it's the holy grail. They even have seats for the holy mass \u2013 not La-Z-Boy level comfort, but who needs a plush seat when you're busy communing with higher powers?\n\nSo, step right in if you're on a quest for divine sarcasm or just want to witness a rebellious twist in the architectural saga.

The colors are so vibrant and the detail is incredible. I spent a good long time just looking at them and trying to take it all in.\n\nThe church is also very peaceful. Even though it was a bit crowded when I visited, it was still a very calming place to be.

I mean, who wouldn\u2019t enjoy the sea under the cool moonlight?\n\nThey have decent changing rooms, wash rooms and a party area of sorts where there is loud music and lots of dancing.
