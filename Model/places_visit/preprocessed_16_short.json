It may not seem so interesting to read but it is even more tempting to see in person. However, this place also needs a lot of care and maintenance like the rest of the historical building. The ponds.which are the lifeblood of this place are dry, the names written on\nthe walls and the garbage spread by the people going there (Cigarette packets chips covers..) are like spots on the moon. This place can be protected and developed as a tourist destination.\nThe original name of this place was Bodhi Ka Taal, which later changed to Budhiya Ka Taal. It is believed that Gautam Buddha stayed here. Buddhist idols have also been found in the excavation of the pond. This place is also known for water chestnut cultivation.",
