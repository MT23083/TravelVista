People can experience walking over the waves, which is amusing. There is also a concrete sea walk, which is a nice place to sit and relax, cherish the sunset. If you are lucky, you will be able to spot dolphins from here. On the downside, there was maintenance activity ongoing around the beach, where I believe they are reconstructing the park, so its noisy and dusty around that area. The beach is also littered and no cleaning staff were present. I would also request the tourist and local people to build awareness on cleanliness and not to litter such places.",
