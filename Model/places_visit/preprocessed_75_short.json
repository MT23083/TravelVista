The picturesque valley is located in the Eastern Ghats and is surrounded by lush green hills and coffee plantations. The journey to Araku Valley is also quite scenic and enjoyable.\n\nOnce you reach there, you can explore the beautiful Borra Caves, which are situated deep in the valley. You can also take a ride on the Araku Valley Railway that offers breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe local food is also something that you must try while you are there. The bamboo chicken, a local delicacy, is a must-try. The hospitality of the locals is also quite notable, making your trip even more memorable.\n\nOverall, Araku Valley is a must-visit destination in India that offers a unique and unforgettable experience.",

The Borra Caves has an entry ticket of \u20b960 for adults which is of course a good experience (be careful with the steps inside).

They are very polite and well mannered.\nI personally had a very good experience.\nI bought the tickets for the attire and dhimsa dance. But i requested the staff to play the original dhimsa music for our dance. But the person having the music had gone for lunch. I got a little upset because the staff were also getting ready for lunch. But i insisted on the music because we were also getting late to return to our resort for which we have to go through a ghat section before getting dark.\nSuddenly i noticed something, that all the staff were moving fast and making arrangements for dhimsa as the person having music came back.\nI literally thank the dhimsa dance crew for leaving their tiffin boxes and food open and started to prepare for dance. They performed the dhimsa dance with original dhimsa music for 25mins.\nHere now i really want to say sorry to the staff and dancing crew that i got upset and insisted on music and dance. They were very humble and did not utter a word and danced for us even though they were hungry and were about to eat. They just sacrificed hunger for me.\nWe were also very hungry and exhausted.But the raagi puttu they served us which was a very less quantity and in leaves. Believe me, that little quantity when we ate, we felt completely active and got good strength. We lost al our restlessness. I asked for more and they served me another cup happily.\nI felt very sorry for the staff and dancing crew.\nThey are very very humble and polite and all were smiling beauties. May God bless them with all success. I request all the tourists to visit this place for sure when visiting araku. These kinds of places will make you get to know our age old tribal customs and rituals.\nI suggest all the tourists to reach this place by the first hour of the day.\nNote: There is no food arrangement near this place.
