The evening ritual ( seva) starts at 6.30 pm , they light hundreds of diyas in the mandir and the evening Aarti enfolds accompanied by lots of musicians playing traditional musical instruments. Post that the deity is taken in a palaquin( palkhi) around the Krishna mutt. Then on the boat in the sarovar all accompanied by the procession of musicians. This around 7.30 pm . Post that the diety is kept on huge almost 30 feet raths , pulled by the devotees .The raths are beautifully illuminated!!! There is traditional Indian music being played. It's a mesmerizing experience. This happens DAILY (except the monsoons ) . This tradition is going on for centuries. It's like time has stopped here, centuries ago ,terms of rituals and traditions being followed. The ambiance too is amazing",
