This old temple is located at joining of two rivers Gomati & Sarya. The approach road to temple passes through narrow roads with local shops in both sides. It is a very busy town with busy traffic and vehicles are not allowed to park near the temple. As this main temple is located at heart of the city and at confluence of two rivers, you need to walk through the lanes to reach this temple. Devotees take bath and then go for Darshan of Lord Shiva known as Bageshwar here. This small but ancient temple has many surrounding temples at the river bank. You can park your vehicle away from the market and walk over the hanging bridge over river and reach the temple",
